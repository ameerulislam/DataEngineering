### Responsibilities and skillsets of a Data Engineer. 
The overarching responsibility of a data engineer
is to provide analytics-ready data to data consumers. Data is analytics-ready when it is accurate,
reliable, complies to regulations it is governed by, and is accessible to consumers when they
need it. 

### At a broad level, Data Engineers: 
Extract, organize, and integrate data from disparate sources, 
Prepare data for analysis and reporting by transforming and cleansing it, 
Design and manage data pipelines that encompass the journey of data from source to destination systems
Setup and manage the infrastructure required for the ingestion, processing, and storage of data.  This can include data platforms, data stores for aggregating source data, distributed systems for large-scale processing of data, and data repositories for storage and dissemination of analysis-ready data. 

### Technical, functional, and soft skills that you may need as a Data Engineer. 
Knowledge of working with operating systems such as UNIX, Linux, and Windows, including commonly used administrative tools, system utilities and commands. 
Knowledge of infrastructure components, such as virtual machines, networking, and application services, such as load balancing and application performance monitoring. Also, cloud-based services such as those offered by Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. 
Experience of working with databases and data warehouses, which include: RDBMSes such as IBM DB2, MySQL, Oracle Database, and PostgreSQL. NoSQL databases such as Redis, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4J. Data warehouses such as Oracle Exadata, IBM Db2 Warehouse on Cloud, IBM Netezza Performance Server, and Amazon RedShift. 
A high-level of proficiency working with data pipelines. Popular data pipeline solutions include Apache
Beam, AirFlow, and DataFLow. Experience of working with ETL tools such as IBM Infosphere Information Server, AWS Glue, and Improvado. 

### Proficiency in languages for querying, manipulating, and processing data. This includes: 
Query languages for accessing and manipulating
data in a database, such as SQL for relational databases and SQL-like query languages for
NoSQL databases. 
Programming languages such as Python, R, and Java. 
Shell and Scripting languages, such as Unix/Linux Shell and PowerShell. 
Familiarity with Big Data processing tools such as Hadoop, Hive, and Spark. 

The data engineering process involves using
several different tools and technologies. Having a working knowledge of comparable technologies
can help you evaluate the trade-offs between different tools and make appropriate recommendations. 

Data engineering is at the intersection of software engineering and data science. In addition to the tools and technologies that data engineers use on a daily basis, they also need to have a keen understanding
of how data scientists, analysts, and business users leverage analysis-ready data. 

Some of the functional skills that will serve you as a Data Engineer, include: The ability to convert business requirements into technical specifications. The ability to work with the complete software
development lifecycle which includes ideation, architecture, design, prototyping, testing,
deployment, and monitoring. 

An understanding of data’s potential application in business. And an understanding of the risks of poor
data management which essentially covers data quality, privacy, security, and compliance. Data engineering is a team sport. You could have multiple data engineers bringing in their specialization to collaborate on a project, closely interacting with the data consumers—which includes the analysts, data scientists, business users, and other technical
teams. 

Interpersonal skills, teamwork, and collaboration,
therefore, are essential for data engineers. As a data engineer, you need to be able to
communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders in a manner
that a clear understanding can be established.
