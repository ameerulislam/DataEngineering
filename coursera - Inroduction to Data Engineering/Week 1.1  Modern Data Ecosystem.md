## Data Types
- Structure 
- Unstructured

## Data Sources
- web
- IOT
- everywhere

## Steps
1. Pull data from origin to data repository. Only acquiring data that I need. Working with data formats, sources, and interfaces through which this data can be pulled.
  - Challenges: Reliability, security, and data integrity of data
2. Raw data now needs to get organized, cleaned up and optimized for access, while conforming to compliances and standards enforced in the organization. So it can be used by end users.
  - Challenges: Data Management, Repositories that provide high availability, flexibility, accessibility, and security. 
3. Finally Users pulling out these information for their use. 
  - Challenges: Getting Interfaces, APIs, Applications in line with end users specific needs.
  - Users such as:- 
  - Business Stackholders (they may need reporst and dashboards)
  - APPs (May need custom APIs to pull this data)
  - Programmers Analysts (they may need raw data to work with)
  - Data Science use cases

## Emerging Tech that are shaping the modern data echosystem
1. Cloud Computing
2. Machine Learning
3. Big Data

### Thanks to cloud technologies: 
- Every enterprise today has access to limitless storage, high-performance computing, open source technologies, machine learning technologies, and the latest tools and libraries. 
- Data Scientists are creating predictive models by training machine learning algorithms on past data.  
- Big Data—Today we’re dealing with datasets that are so massive and so varied that traditional tools and analysis methods are no longer adequate, paving the way for new tools and techniques and also new knowledge and insights. We’ll learn more about Big Data and its influence in shaping business decisions further along in this course.
