### Data engineering within the modern data ecosystem. 
In the simplest possible terms, the field
of Data Engineering concerns itself with the mechanics for the flow and access of data. And its goal is to make quality data available
for fact-finding and data-driven decision making. As data has grown, so has the field of data
engineering. From data being available in a single database
that was relatively easier to manageâ€”the world of data has grown to include wide-ranging
sources, structures, and types of data. The field of Data Engineering concerns itself
with the tasks of collecting source data includes extracting,
integrating, and organizing data from disparate sources. To collect required data, you need to: Develop tools, workflows, and processes that
help you acquire data from multiple sources. Design, build, and maintain scalable data
architecture to store data. Data could be stored in databases, data warehouses,
data lakes, or any other type of data repository. Processing data includes cleaning, transforming,
and preparing data so that it is usable. For this, you need to: Implement and maintain distributed systems
for large-scale processing of data. Design pipelines for the extraction, transformation,
and loading of data into data repositories. Design or implement solutions for validating
and safeguarding quality, privacy, and security of data. Optimize tools, systems, and workflows for
performance, reliability, and scalability. Ensure data meets all regulatory and compliance
guidelines. Storing data for reliable and easy availability
of data. For this, you need to: Architect or implement data stores for the
storage of processed data. Ensure systems are scalable, keeping in mind
the evolving nature of data and business needs. Ensure tools and systems are in place that
take care of data privacy, security, compliance, monitoring, backup, and recovery. Making data available to users securely. This includes the use of: APIs, services, and programs that retrieve
data on defined parameters for use by end-users. Interfaces and dashboards that present data
to users so they can derive insights from the data. Ensure the right measures and checks and balances
are in place to keep data secure and provide rights-based access to users. It is important to mention that data engineering
is a team sport. No one person is expected to have all the
knowledge, skills, and specializations required for the wide-ranging tasks covered within
the scope of data engineering. For example, to architect any data management
system, be it for collating source data or storing processed analysis-ready data, you
need to have the skills of an architect. To ensure data stores are available and optimized
for use, you need to have expertise in databases. Similarly, proficiency in database tools,
programming languages, and distributed systems all come under data engineering, but they
may require different skill sets. Also, not all teams and organizations need
to set up an end-to-end data engineering practice. There are tools, applications, and solutions
available in the market, both on-premise and cloud-based, that can be evaluated for individual
needs. In this video, we learned how data engineering
works to provide a robust and scalable structure to make quality data available for decision-making. More than any other data profession, data
engineering is about the tools and technologies involved in data manipulation. But it is also about understanding the complexities
of data and how it is ultimately leveraged for fact-finding and decision-making.
